#Objective: To create a Java project on GitHub and collaborate with other developers to build and maintain the project.

#Instructions:

#Section-1.

Create a new repository on GitHub and initialize it with a README file.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Create a new Java project in the repository.
Create a Main class that contains a main method. The main method should print out "Hello, world!".
Commit and push the changes to the master branch.
Add a new class to the project, such as a Person class that has the following attributes:
 name - a string that represents the name of the person.
 age - an integer that represents the age of the person.
Implement a constructor for the Person class that takes in the name and age attributes as parameters.
Implement getter and setter methods for the name and age attributes.
Commit and push the changes to the master branch.


#section-2.

Create a new branch called feature-branch.
Add a new method to the Person class that returns a boolean indicating whether the person is an adult (age >= 18).
Update the Main class to create a Person object and use the new method to check if the person is an adult.
Commit and push the changes to the feature-branch.
Create a pull request to merge the feature-branch into the master branch.
Assige me as (AnuradhaKumari201) a code Reviewer .
 Work on feedback and wait till it gets approved.
Once the pull request has been approved, merge the feature-branch into the master branch.
Once the pull request has been approved, merge the feature-branch into the master branch.

#Section-3.

Create a new branch called bugfix-branch.
Fix a bug in the Person class, such as a typo in the age attribute.
Commit and push the changes to the bugfix-branch.
Create a pull request to merge the bugfix-branch into the master branch.
Assige me as (AnuradhaKumari201) a code Reviewer .
Once the pull request has been approved, merge the bugfix-branch into the master branch.
Delete the feature-branch and bugfix-branch from both the local and remote repositories.

#Done
